HTML Video

❮ Previous
Next ❯


The HTML <video> element is used to 
show a video on a web page.


Video

Example
Courtesy of Big Buck Bunny:





    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
  


Try it Yourself »




The HTML <video> Element
To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element:

Example

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Try it Yourself »



How it Works
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page 
might flicker while the video loads.
The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video 
files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed 
in browsers that do not 
support the <video> element.



HTML <video> Autoplay
To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute:

Example

<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Try it Yourself »


Note: Chromium browsers do not 
allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add muted after 
autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted):

Example

<video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the 
<video> element.

HTML Video - Methods, Properties, and Events
The HTML DOM defines methods, properties, and events for the <video> element.
This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume.
There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc.

Example: Using JavaScript


Play/Pause
Big
Small
Normal
